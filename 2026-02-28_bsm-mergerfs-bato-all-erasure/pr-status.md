# PR Status — BATO-ALL ROMs Erasure

## No PR from this session

**batocera.linux:** The fix (correct grep pattern `" $POOL_PATH "` + unmount retry loop) was **merged upstream by someone else**. We did not open a PR or make commits to batocera.linux.

**Our work:** Root cause analysis, grep bug identification, local deployment of patched `batocera-storage-manager` via FileZilla and `batocera-save-overlay`. Validated with BATO-LG and BATO-PARROT merges — no erasure.
