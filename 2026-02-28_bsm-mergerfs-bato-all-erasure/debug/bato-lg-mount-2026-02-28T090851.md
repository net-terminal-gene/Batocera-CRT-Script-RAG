**Captured:** 2026-02-28T09:08:51 (SSH)

## Timeline (from storage log)

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 08:59:37 | Boot: BATO-ALL mounted, BATO-LG missing → REFRESH with `.roms_base:BATO-ALL` only |
| 08:59:40 | BATO-LG (sdb1) detected, mounted at /media/BATO-LG |
| 08:59:41 | REFRESH: Pool rebuilt with `.roms_base:BATO-ALL:BATO-LG` |
| 09:06:12 | **EJECT:** BATO-LG abruptly removed (user unplugged?) |
| 09:06:13 | Pool rebuilt with `.roms_base:BATO-ALL` only |
| 09:06:19 | BATO-LG (sdb1) detected again, mounted at /media/BATO-LG |
| 09:06:19 | WARN: volume was not unmounted cleanly |
| 09:07:29 | **MERGE:** User triggered merge from UI |
| 09:07:29 | MERGE: Added /media/BATO-LG/roms to boot config |
| 09:07:29 | **MERGE: Moving internal ROMs to base directory** |

## State at capture

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| mergerFS mount | `userdata/.roms_base:media/BATO-ALL/roms` (2 branches only) |
| Boot config | `mergerfs.roms=/userdata/roms@/media/BATO-ALL/roms:/media/BATO-LG/roms` |
| BATO-LG mounted | Yes (`/dev/sdb1` on `/media/BATO-LG`) |
| BATO-ALL count | 50 systems |

## Finding: BATO-LG not in pool despite config

Boot config includes BATO-LG, and BATO-LG is physically mounted, but the mergerFS pool currently has only `.roms_base` and BATO-ALL. BATO-LG may need a manual REFRESH or reboot to be included.

## BATO-ALL verification — no erasure
