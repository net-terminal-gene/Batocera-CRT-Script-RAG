## Findings

- **Eject flow:** User triggered eject from UI → storage manager removed BATO-LG from boot config → unmounted pool → rebuilt pool with remaining drives (BATO-ALL) → unmounted BATO-LG → sent reloadgames to ES.
- **No merge ran:** Eject does not run the merge "move" logic; no erasure risk.
- **BATO-ALL intact:** BATO-ALL (mmcblk0p1) remains in pool. BATO-LG (sdb1) was the ejected drive.
